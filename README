Epiphany Branch to support XML/JSON output?

The purpose of this branch is mainly to use Epiphany only as an API.
This is an exelent and easy way to have a RESTful service up and running in no Time.

the URL looks nice and clean but it was missing the possibility to output XML (although hardly anyone uses XML these days).
I also needed a way to use dynamic arguments.
